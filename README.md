# ML-Case-Study-University-of-Mannheim
Notebook to provide a brief example of how one could approach the Lending-Club dataset - to predict customers rating being A/B or worse.
Initially created for a case study event that I made for zeb at University of Mannheim in cooperation with STADS.
The Notebook is not meant to be a sample solution as it was created within limited time, and is not an official zeb document.

The data used is the Lendingclub-Dataset - train and test data are part of the repo.
